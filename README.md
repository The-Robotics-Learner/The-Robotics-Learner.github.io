•First, prep the Pizza Box.  Get a clean pizza box and cut out the bottom square.  Then you can use the edge of a table to fold it in half.
The idea here is to use brads and paperclips as your wire.
•Power!  Pick the place on your board where you want the battery.  Place a paperclip on that spot and with the nail or something  poke holes just inside the ends of the clip. 
•Then rotate the paperclip 90 degrees and poke 2 more holes.  
•Push a brad through the left hole and another brad through a paperclip and through the right hole. 
•Now flip the board over.  
•Now on the back side place a paperclip over the 2 brads and secure it by flattening them out.  This is your negative connection. 
•Place tape over the brad pins.
•Put brads in the top and bottom holes.  
•The top needs a paperclip on the front.  on the back you are going to sandwich the battery between the clip going left right and one going top bottom.  Make sure the battery  is in the right way (positive is facing you and touching the top and bottom pins.
•Now secure it by spreading the brad pins and applying tape. 
•Your battery is now set
•Flip over the board so you see the front and test the clips with the LED.  (The longer LED leg is positive) If the LED lights you can move on.
Components Requirement
•1 - Pizza Box/Cardboard 
•1 - White or Blue LED  
•1 - Piezoelectric Buzzer
•1 - LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
•1 - 3 Volt Button Cell Battery
•~ 25 Metal Brads  
•~ 20 Paperclips
•Tape

•cut the head off the toothbrush
•Use your fingers to spread out the bristles. For improved stability, place a book on top of the toothbrush head with the bristles spread for several minutes
•expose about 1/4″ of wire on each of the leads coming from the motor.
•Cut a piece of mounting tape slightly smaller than a googly eye
Use the sticky side to attach one of the wires from the motor to the front of the cell battery in the location you would like to stick the googly eye.
•Peel off the backing and stick a googly eye on.
Apply another piece of mounting tape for the second eye (without putting a wire under this side).
•Peel off backing and apply second googly eye.
•Use mounting tape to apply motor to toothbrush. It’s fun to experiment with the placement of the motor. Too far in one direction will cause the bot to tip over from being too heavy on one side. Too far in the other direction will cause it to spin so fast it eventually flips over. . Make sure not to tape down the spinning part of the motor.
•Use another piece of mounting tape to attach the second wire to the opposite side of the battery. Note that at this point the motor will start spinning.
•Place another piece of mounting tape onto the non-spinning end of the motor and the front of the toothbrush. Peel off the backing.
•Peel the backing off the tape on the battery and attach it to the tape on the motor.
•Put it down and watch it spin!
Components requirement
•toothbrusth 
•Mini vibration motor
•Mounting tape
•3V cell battery 
•Googly eyes

•Using a paperclip and foil, design a diver. The diver should be approximated an inch and a half tall.
•Cut the straw and position it on the paper-clip as show above.  Each end should be secured by the ends of the paper •Slowly slide the straw onto the diver as show above.  The diver should look like he’s wearing a scuba tank.
•Place a small piece of play-dough or putty on the diver’s feet.
• Fill a glass with water and put the diver in.  This is to test to make sure it floats.  It should float as shown above.  If it doesn’t float, you’re straw may have a hole in it.  Try again with a new straw.
• Fill the two liter bottle with water.  Make sure to fill it to the top, otherwise the experiment won’t work.  Carefully place the diver into the bottle and screw on the lid.
• Squeeze the bottle and watch as the diver sinks to the bottle.  Stop squeezing and he will float back to the top.
Components Requirement
Empty Plastic Two Liter Bottle
Drinking Straw
Small Paper Clip
Play-dough or Reusable Adhesive Putty
Thick Foil (I used a Foil Pan)

•First, you'll need to remove the second leg of the metal binder clip. Simply pinch the sides together near the top of the clip and wiggle it out.
•Using a little hot glue, adhere the metal binder clip flat onto the popsicle stick, about 1.5"" from one end. Make sure not to use too much hot glue or the copper wire won't fit through the binder's hole.
•Next, cut (and strip if necessary) about 2.5"" - 3"" of copper wire. Feed the wire through the two holes of the binder clip. Previously, these holes were holding the leg we removed. Twist the wire around the back of the popsicle stick and try to make it lay flat.
•Then, take one strip of copper tape (or tin foil) and place it on the back of the popsicle stick. It should cover the twisted copper wire and go almost to the end, leaving about .25"" - .5"" at the other end of the popsicle stick free.
•Flip your popsicle stick back over, so the metal binder clip is facing up.
•Lay another piece of copper tape (or tin foil) down the front of the popsicle stick. It should run from one end to about .5"" from the metal clip. Make sure it doesn't touch the metal clip or your flashlight won't work (because positive and negative will be touching).
•Bend the extra bit of copper tape back, so the sticky side is up, place the positive side of the battery (the smooth side) down onto the sticky copper tape and press it firmly down so it touches and lays flat against the popsicle stick.
•The final step is adding the LED! If you've followed my steps thus far, the positive side is the top (or side with the metal clip) and the negative side is the bottom (or side with the twisted wire).
•The LED's cathode (long lead) goes on top, and it's anode (short lead) goes on the bottom. Affix your LED in place with some non-conductive tape. Make sure both leads are touching their respective copper tape sides. If you want to test that your light works before taping it in place, just flip the switch.
Components Requirement
•Jumbo popsicle stick 
•medium size metal binder clip
•copper wire (22 guage, solid)
•3V coin cell battery (CR 2032)
•LED 
•copper tape (or tin foil, if you really want to keep costs down)

•First you want to prepare the outer critter. You will need to cut the head from the egg carton and each pipe cleaner into thirds or more depending on how many legs you want your critter to have.
•First you will need to punch two holes for the eyes of your critter. I found that the seam ripper was the easiest tool to create the holes. •Next you need to add holes for the critters legs. You can use the seam ripper or a hole puncher. After creating the holes, add the legs and bend them inside so that they don't slip out of the body. Finally add your two LED eyes.
•Place the coin cell battery between the leads to create a complete circuit. If one of the LEDs does not light up, pull it out and turn it around. Lastly tape both sides of the battery to the leads.
Components Requirement
•cardboard egg carton
•two LEDs
•3V coin cell battery
•2 pipe cleaners
